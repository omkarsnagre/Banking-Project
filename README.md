🏦 Banking System Project
Overview 🌟
Welcome to the Banking System! 🎉
This Java-based application manages user accounts and financial transactions. Whether you're creating a new account, transferring funds, or checking your balance, this system has you covered!

Key Features 🔑
User Registration & Login: Securely create and manage user accounts.
Account Creation: Set up and configure new bank accounts.
Debit and Credit Transactions: Perform deposits and withdrawals with ease.
Money Transfer: Transfer funds between accounts securely.
Balance Inquiry: Check account balances at any time.
Robust Security: Ensures all transactions and data remain secure using encapsulation to protect sensitive information.
Tech Stack ⚙️
This project is built using:

Java: Core application logic.
JDBC: For seamless connectivity between Java and the database.
MySQL: Handles the application's database needs.
Security Implementation:
We have implemented encapsulation in the code to ensure that sensitive user data, such as account details and transaction information, is not exposed or accessible directly. This protects the integrity of the system by allowing controlled access to critical data via getter and setter methods, safeguarding it from unauthorized access or modifications.

Getting Started 🚀
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourBankingSystemRepo.git
Set up MySQL:
Create a new database named banking_system and the necessary tables for user accounts and transactions.

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    account_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id INT NOT NULL,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(account_id)
);
Configure your MySQL database settings in BankingApp.java:
java
Copy code
private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_system"; // Database URL
private static final String DB_USER = "root"; // MySQL username
private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "root"; // MySQL password
Compile and Run the Application:
bash
Copy code
javac *.java
java BankingApp
Usage 📋
Upon running the application, you'll be presented with a menu to choose from various banking operations (account management, deposits, transfers, balance checks, etc.). Follow the on-screen instructions to input account details, perform transactions, and more.
